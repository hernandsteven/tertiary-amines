# Tertiary Amines
Web-scraping script that extracts Tertiary Amines compound PubChem ID's from https://www.fishersci.co.uk/ database. 


Then uses PubChem API to extract 3D coordinates using the previously acquired PubChem ID's.

Finally, I use the 3D coordinates to generate .XYZ files to view the molecules structure using Protein Viewer software.
